# html-frontend
the frontend part of the fundMe contract. 

At the time of writing this I was taking the fullstack web3 course by patrick collins & freecodecamp, as advised I decided to push every single project I have completed to my repo
it is the front end of a fundme smart contract, you can deposit into the smart contract, withdraw from it and check the balance of it
